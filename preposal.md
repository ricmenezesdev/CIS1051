# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm interested in learning how API's connect on each other. I also would like to do the project on Python tho I have experience coding on HTML/CSS and JS. 

1) Responsive website to suggest motorcycle rides based on choice of miles/hours riding. Conected to google maps.

2) a program to solve Wordle

3) a program that run on my printer where every file I print or scam have a copy sent to my cloud.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I'll be working solo. 


## Do you have any questions of your own?

I have a vague idea of what RESTfull API are but I don't know how to build one. That's what I'll atempt to learn from my final project. 
So I'd appreciate help pointing me to the right direction.
