Project Wordle Puzzle Solver

by Ricardo Menezes


        The objective of the project was to develop an app where users could visit the index page, click a button and have the Wordle puzzle of the day solved. 
 While I couldn't achieve completion, I have made significant progress in following areas. 

        File Reading and Data Manipulation: Implemented functionality to read and manipulate over 3.5k words file on web with Python.
        Back-end / Front-end Communication: Established a RESTful API using FLASK and requests library.
        Index layout: simple and fun user-friendly interface designed with HTML/CSS.
        Installing and machine setup: preparing my computer with Python installations, Environment variable path, pip install, Flask and CORS (for handling HTTP requests), Selenium   and Chrome webdriver (for browser interaction)

        In scrap.py you will find an incomplete snip of code using Selenium to interact with NYT Wordle page. It's still unclear how to set up the function needed but the sends a request and opens the Wordle webpage. 

        Although I am still processing the lessons from this project I have undoubtedly expanded my toolkit and knowledge. Each challenge encountered has provided valuable insights contributing to my growth as a developer.
