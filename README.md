Project Wordle Puzzle Solver

by Ricardo Menezes


The objective of the project was to develop an app where one could go to the index page, click a button and have the Wordle's puzzle of the day solved. 
        I didn't archive that. I could accomplish: file reading and data manipulation - back-end / front-end communication - index page layout


The learning objective I had was to focus on API and to learn how back-end communicates with front-end. I did learn a lot on that matter. 
        Frameworks: Flask - beginner friendly library I used to connect the back-end to client-side. I took some learning to pip install it but the syntax was straight forward. 
                    Selenium and WebDriver- used to interact with web applications and I took me time to download and install those apps. I couldn't make it work with Wordle website and so far I haven't figured out why. 
        HTML and CSS: I had knowledge of it already and I have learned more during the process
        JS: I have some knowledge of JS tho It was new to me fetch function and how to connect it to back end (python)

The visual HTML/CSS I'm familiar with even tho I'm not a Web Designer I can put the elements where I feel like. 

Mostly I learned how there's libraries and and scripts like CORS in the process of connecting back-end to client-side and it depends on the language you're coding with. 
It all still setting down to me and I'm not even comfortable to talk about what I've learned but I come out of this project know more tools that I knew before. 

PS>: scrap.py is the code I couldn't make it work. The interaction with NYT Wordle app is not clear to me how to make it. Tho I have worked hard setting up ChromeDriver (browser automate tool) and Selenium.
